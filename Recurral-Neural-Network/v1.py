# Recurrent Neural Network



# Part 1 - Data Preprocessing

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the training set
dataset_train = pd.read_csv('stockBankA_train.csv')
training_set = dataset_train.iloc[:, 1:2].values

# Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
sc = MinMaxScaler(feature_range = (0, 1))
training_set_scaled = sc.fit_transform(training_set)

# Creating a data structure with 60 timesteps and 1 output
X_train = []
y_train = []
for i in range(480, 27898):
    X_train.append(training_set_scaled[i-480:i, 0])
    y_train.append(training_set_scaled[i, 0])
X_train, y_train = np.array(X_train), np.array(y_train)

# Reshaping
X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))

# Part 2 - Building the RNN

# Importing the Keras libraries and packages
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import LSTM
